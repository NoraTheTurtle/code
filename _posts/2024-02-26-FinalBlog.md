## summary of changes
In the level four my mail focaus was to change the feeling of the level, and to make it look/stand out from the other levels.  
<br>

###### background & player
To do this the first thing I did was change the background to an underwater theme my changing the img src, then I decided to create a new player and make it a fish to allow it to fit in with the background.  I did this by editing gameSetup.js.  I struggled getting the dimentions correrct because the sprite sheet was unevenly places, in the end I handmoved the sprites to allow it to work better, although that made the image a little blurry the frames looked a lot cleaner.  
<br>

###### Tube ---> Portal
Then I worked on changing the editing tube, I decided to take insperation from my begining tri2 game and re-add in a portal that matching the underwater background,  with this I changed the space level background to make it seem as though you are entering and exiting a portal.
<br>

###### new enemy
My next focaus was with the enemy, I decided to create a new enemy instead of keeping the simple goomba, I made it so that every so often the enemy speeds up like it did in the game levels from the begining of the trimester. 
<br>

###### platforms
finally I needed to change the platforms.  Originall I was going to add little clouds, but I landed on bubbles to fit the underwater theme.  I changed the image and dimentions to fit and imputed it into gameSetup.js.

## Overall
Overall I had a lot of fun working on this project, I was able to create a new game level and make it look and feel like a diffrent part of the game not just a duplicate of the level before it! I feel that at the begining of the trimester I would not have been able to comeplete this projet but now I feel much more confident in my skills.
