- Monday - looking into the next project and getting assigned new groups (me, katie, gabriel, kaden, learboard team) brainstorming new features and ideas to add

- Wednesday - working on testing out our table (making a new button to link to a table)

- Thursday - creating and testing a button to add a row to the table when we need to input scores

- Friday - finalizing table and working with scoring team to figure out how to record scores
